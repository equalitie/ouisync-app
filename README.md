Ouisync is a free and open source tool enabling peer-to-peer file syncing and
sharing between devices. With or without the internet. For more information,
please visit the project's home page at https://ouisync.net.

This repository implements the GUI for the [Ouisync library](https://github.com/equalitie/ouisync).

Currently supported operating systems are Android, Windows and Linux.

## Git clone

This repository uses git submodules. As such, use the following commands to clone it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/equalitie/ouisync-app
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Compilation

You'll need [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and other dependencies corresponding to the target platform:

* Windows: [Dokan](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/releases) (User mode file system)
* Android: [SDK](https://developer.android.com/) and [NDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk)
* Linux: `sudo apt-get install pkg-config libfuse-dev appindicator3-0.1 libsecret-1-dev`

Then to build the app:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter <build|run> -d <windows|android|linux>
```

If you choose `android` above, also use the `--flavor <production|nightly|unoficial>` argument.

## Running tests

On Linux:

```bash
# Build Ouisync service library
cargo build -p ouisync-service --manifest-path=ouisync/Cargo.toml
# Run tests
OUISYNC_LIB=ouisync/target/debug/libouisync_service.so flutter test
```

On Windows

```bat
rem Build Ouisync service library
cargo build -p ouisync-service --manifest-path=ouisync/Cargo.toml
rem Set environment variable to point to ouisync_service.dll
set OUISYNC_LIB=ouisync/target/debug/ouisync_service.dll
rem Run tests
flutter test
```

Some info on debugging tests can be found in [test/README.md](./test/README.md).

## Docker

We have *Dockerfiles* for
[Linux](https://github.com/equalitie/ouisync-app/blob/master/docker/dev/linux/Dockerfile)
and
[Windows](https://github.com/equalitie/ouisync-app/blob/master/docker/dev/windows/Dockerfile)
which contain the development environment although at time of writing they are
somewhat outdated (TODO).

   - If your development platform is Linux, you can use the Dockerfile to
     create the Linux desktop or the Android app.

   - Similarly, you can use the Windows Dockerfile to create the Windows
     desktop or the Android app.

## Localization

We use the package [`intl_utils`](https://pub.dev/packages/intl_utils) for handling the localization of the strings used in the app.

To add/modify a localized string, modify the [English `.arb`
file](lib/l10n/intl_en.arb), and run the following to generate the dart code.

```bash
dart run intl_utils:generate
```

## Testing

This project is tested with [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/).

## Sentry (optional)

Ouisync integrates Sentry, via the `sentry_flutter` plugin.

For initialization, you need to get a client key, called _DSN_, from a Sentry instance, making it available via an `.env` file, or as a environment variable using `export`, and then using [envied](https://github.com/petercinibulk/envied)

Please follow the instructions in the package repository for [envied in GitHub](https://github.com/petercinibulk/envied#table-of-contents) to add a key called `DSN`, that contains the client key.

## App suffix

To install multiple versions of the app on the same device (e.g., one production and one development), you can differentiate them with the "app suffix". This can be done either with the `APP_SUFFIX` environment variable during build, or with the `app.suffix` property in `android/local.properties` (if both are specified, the env var takes priority).
